Lawrence Tech University, Software Engineering class project, Spring 2019

Team: Thomas Hwang, Austin Ramsey, Rod Mesquita<br>
Project: Windows Console Application that attempts to diagnose dementia by quizzing patients.<br>
Requirements: Based on this website: https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/dementia-early-signs<br>
Program overview:<br>
Prompt users on console window, for each question user say yes, we increment the grading counter. Upon the end of the questionaire, the diagone will be based on the sum (grade).<br>
The exact questions will be based on the "Ten warning signs of dementia" from the aforementioned website.<br>
Disclaimer: this is not a complete diagnoses tool. Six types of assessment can help to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of dementia. For a sure answer, the user must consult with their primary care doctor.<br>
